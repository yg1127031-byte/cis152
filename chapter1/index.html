    <p>Hello Professor and class, my preferred beverage is coffee, the reason that's my preferred beverage is because my grandmother used to make coffee from scratch since she was little. But after her passing I would buy store made coffee because I can't do what she did when she was much younger with her younger siblings. And also there is so many flavors, you can make your own type of flavors with coffee. </p>
