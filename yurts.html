    <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
      <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures set four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a beautiful roof dome that can be opened for stargazing.</dd>

      <dt><strong>How are the yurts finished?</strong></dt>
      <dd>Each yurt features a queen-size bed with a down quilt and a gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and modern facilities located in the lodge.</dd>

      <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
      <dd>Most guests bring their own comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress in layers for the coastal weather. Itâ€™s also helpful to bring a flashlight and a spirit of adventure!</dd>
